// functions starting with use are called hooks
// useState is a built in hook provided by react
// it lets you add state to functional components

// you can find other built-in hooks in the API reference:
// https://react.dev/reference/react

// you can also write your own hooks by combining built-in hooks that 
// already exist

// hooks are more restrictive than other functions
// you can only call hooks at the top of your components or other hooks
// if you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new
// component and put it there
